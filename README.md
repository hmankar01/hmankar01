## Selected Technical Projects

### GridLLM: Agentic AI for California Electricity Market Operations
- Orchestrated a multi-agent system using LangGraph to navigate 400+ regulatory protocols for the California Independent System Operator (CAISO).
- Executed Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on Llama 3.2-3B using QLORA to specialize the model for technical energy jargon and market logs.
- Developed a Hybrid Architecture combining LLM reasoning with Association Rule Mining on two years of time-series data to prevent hallucinations in mathematical logic.

### Crypto Market Return Forecasting | Top 20% Global Rank
- Engineered over 800 market microstructure and statistical features from a high-frequency cryptocurrency dataset consisting of more than 500,000 records.
- Architected a Deep Learning Conv1D and MLP neural network in Python using PyTorch, implementing a custom Pearson loss function to optimize for signal-to-noise ratios.

### Financial Fraud Detection System
- Developed a production-grade big data pipeline processing 780,000+ transactions for credit risk detection.
- Utilized XGBoost and CatBoost classifiers to achieve a 94% recall rate, validating model stability through rigorous time-series backtesting and statistical evaluation.

### Real-Time Voice AI Architecture (Crisis Response)
- Engineered a Voice AI Agent using Azure OpenAI and Twilio to provide immediate crisis response support with sub-800ms latency.
- Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to ground model responses in a validated global database of 10,000+ emergency records.
